  <h1>Privacy Policy for GASTrack</h1>

  <p>GASTrack is an Android application developed by Enterprise Consultancy Services (ECS) and is used exclusively by authorized employees and clients of a designated corporate customer. It provides secure, encrypted access to internal systems when users are outside the corporate network. This Privacy Policy explains what information GASTrack collects, how it is used and protected, and the rights of our users. The app’s design ensures minimal data collection, and it complies with Google Play’s policies, including the Android VpnService requirements.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <p>The app collects only the information needed for its core functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> Basic identifiers used to authenticate the user.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational Data:</strong> Work-related inputs provided by the user (e.g., daily income, fuel logs).</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Network data necessary for secure VPN communication.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The app does not collect personal identifiers or sensitive data unrelated to its operation. No personal tracking, advertising, or analytics are performed.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate and authorize users.</li>
    <li>To provide daily logging and reporting features.</li>
    <li>To establish a secure VPN connection outside the corporate network.</li>
    <li>To monitor functionality and troubleshoot issues using anonymized logs.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Data is not used for marketing or shared with external parties.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

  <p>No user data is shared with third parties. All information remains within secure, private infrastructure unless disclosure is required by law.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>

  <p>Information is retained only as long as necessary for business or legal purposes and securely deleted thereafter.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>

  <p>All data is encrypted in transit. VPN data is encrypted end-to-end. Security practices include encrypted storage, restricted access, and regular updates.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>VPN and Security</h2>

  <p>GASTrack uses Android’s VpnService API to create a secure VPN tunnel to internal resources when the device is outside the corporate network. VPN is not activated on internal networks. All VPN traffic is encrypted. The app does not log personal browsing or collect sensitive data through VPN. Users are informed of VPN use and must grant explicit permission before it is initiated.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>User Rights and Controls</h2>

  <p>Authorized users may contact their internal administrators for data access, correction, or deletion requests. GASTrack does not manage or expose personal data directly to users.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

  <p>GASTrack is not intended for children. No information is knowingly collected from individuals under 18.</p>
