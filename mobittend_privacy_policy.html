      <section>
        <p>Mobittend is an attendance application developed and maintained by <strong>Enterprise Consultancy Services (ECS)</strong>. The app is intended for use by authorized employees and clients of a corporate customer to manage and record workplace attendance from a mobile device. This Privacy Policy explains what information Mobittend collects, how that information is used, how it is protected, and the rights and choices available to users.</p>
      </section>

      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <p>Mobittend is designed to collect only the information necessary for attendance and related features. Types of information that may be collected include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account &amp; Authentication Data.</strong> Basic identifiers and credentials required to authenticate and authorize access to the app (for example: username, employee ID, authentication tokens).</li>
        <li><strong>Attendance &amp; Operational Data.</strong> Records created when users clock in/out or otherwise log attendance (timestamps, shift IDs, notes entered by the user).</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data.</strong> Location information may be collected and linked to your identity in order to verify or record the location of an attendance action, when this feature is enabled.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical &amp; Device Data.</strong> Device- and connection-related technical information needed to secure communications and operate the service (for example: device model, OS version, IP address, app version, error logs).</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymized/aggregated diagnostics.</strong> Where necessary for troubleshooting or improving service, Mobittend may collect anonymized or aggregated logs that do not identify an individual.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mobittend does <strong>not</strong> collect personal data beyond what is necessary for attendance and operational functionality; it is not used for advertising or unrelated profiling.</p>

      <h2>How we use information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Authenticate and authorize users.</li>
        <li>Record, store, and present attendance and related reports to authorized personnel.</li>
        <li>Verify attendance location where the feature is enabled.</li>
        <li>Troubleshoot, monitor, and improve app functionality using anonymized diagnostics.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal or contractual obligations as required.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Data collected for these purposes will not be used for marketing or sold to third parties.</p>

      <h2>Data sharing and disclosure</h2>
      <p>Mobittend may share data only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Employer / Authorized Administrators.</strong> Attendance records and associated data are accessible to the employer or authorized administrators as part of normal operation of the service.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> ECS may engage trusted third-party service providers (for example: hosting or infrastructure providers) who process data on our behalf under contract and only to the extent required to provide their service.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal requirements.</strong> We will disclose data if required to do so by law, regulation, or valid legal process.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unless required to operate the service or by law, Mobittend does not publicly share user data.</p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>We retain data only as long as necessary for business, operational, or legal purposes. Retention periods may be determined by the employing organization’s policies or applicable law. When data is no longer required, we securely delete or de-identify it.</p>

      <h2>Data security</h2>
      <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect data, including encryption in transit and reasonable controls for data access and storage. Access to user data is restricted to authorized personnel and service providers. While we take reasonable steps to protect information, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

      <h2>User rights and controls</h2>
      <p>If you are an authorized user, contact your internal administrator or employer for requests to access, correct, or delete your attendance records. For questions about ECS’s handling of personal data or to request assistance, contact our data team at <a href="mailto:dev@ecs-co.com">dev@ecs-co.com</a>.</p>

      <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>Mobittend is not intended for use by children under 18. We do not knowingly collect information from minors.</p>

      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Material changes will be posted here with a new revision date.</p>
